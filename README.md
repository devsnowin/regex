# Something about RegEx :worried:

_Small note 📝_

I usually avoided this topic when I was learning Python in college 😅.
It is now time to learn it 📖.

## what is RegEx or Regular Expressions?

It's a series of characters that allow us to check for matches.
Eg: E-mail validation in forms

RegEx looks like this 👇
`js
^[a-zA-Z0-9]+(?:\.[a-zA-Z0-9]+)*@[a-zA-Z0-9]+(?:\.[a-zA-Z0-9]+)*$
`
